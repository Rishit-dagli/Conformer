This repo implements [Conformer: Convolution-augmented Transformer for Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08100) by Gulati et al. in TensorFlow. _**Conformer**_ achieves the best of both worlds (transformers for content-based global interactions and CNNs to  exploit local features) by studying how to combine convolution neural networks and transformers to model both local and global dependencies of an audio sequence in a parameter-efficient way.

It also significantly outperforms the previous Transformer and CNN based models achieving state-of-the-art accuracies.

## Installation

Run the following to install:

```sh
pip install conformer-tf
```

## Developing conformer-tf

To install `conformer-tf`, along with tools you need to develop and test, run the following in your virtualenv:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Rishit-dagli/Conformer.git
# or clone your own fork

cd Conformer
pip install -e .[dev]
```

To run rank and shape tests run the following:

```sh
pytest --verbose
```

## Usage

In this section, I show a minimal example of creating a Convolutional Module, one of the main contributions of the paper and a Conformer block as well.

### Create a Convolutional Module

```py
import tensorflow as tf
from conformer_tf import ConformerConvModule

layer = ConformerConvModule(
    dim = 512,
    causal = False,             # whether it is auto-regressive
    expansion_factor = 2,       # what multiple of the dimension to expand for the depthwise convolution
    kernel_size = 31,
    dropout = 0.
)

x = tf.random.normal([1, 1024, 512])
x = layer(x) + x # (1, 1024, 512)
```

### Create a Conformer Block

```py
import tensorflow as tf
from conformer_tf import ConformerBlock

conformer_block = ConformerBlock(
    dim = 512,
    dim_head = 64,
    heads = 8,
    ff_mult = 4,
    conv_expansion_factor = 2,
    conv_kernel_size = 31,
    attn_dropout = 0.,
    ff_dropout = 0.,
    conv_dropout = 0.
)

x = tf.random.normal([1, 1024, 512])
conformer_block(x) # (1, 1024, 512)
```
